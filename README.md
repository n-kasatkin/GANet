# GANet

Thanks [feihuzhang/GANet](https://github.com/feihuzhang/GANet) for their great work.

### Changes
`predict_husky.py` is added to generate disparities of two images. See example of running in `predict_husky.sh`. Note that the model assumes that you have rectified images.  
There might be a problem with very slow inference as it is mentioned here: [GANet/issues/93](https://github.com/feihuzhang/GANet/issues/93).
